### Hi there 👋, I'm Ali Mokhtaary 
==================================

👨‍💻 I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.

🤖 My primary interest lies at the intersection of Machine Learning and Systems, where I explore innovative ways to enhance system performance and enable seamless delivery of ML services.

🐳 Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of orchestration and containerization through [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

🚀 My ongoing research focuses on cost optimization strategies for deploying deep learning applications on heterogeneous Cloud computing platforms. Particularly, I am actively engaged in projects aimed at reducing the cost associated with deploying deep learning applications on AWS EC2 instances. 

💬 Ask me about my [research](research), and I'd be delighted to share my insights! 

🎵 Fun Facts:
   - 🎶 I have a deep passion for music, especially the legendary [Mohammadreza Shajarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad-Reza_Shajarian).
